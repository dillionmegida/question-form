[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/questionnaire.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/questionnaire) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save questionnaire
```

## Usage

This component requires a `questions` prop of type array. The required format of the questions array is:

```js
[
    {
        question: 'What is React?',
        options: [
            "React is this",
            "React is that",
            "React is cool"
        ],
        answer: 0
    },
    {
        question: 'What is science?',
        ...
    },
    ...
]
```

Result:

Every question should be in form of objects with three keys: question (`string`), options (`array`) and answer (`number`) which is the index of the answer in the options array.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import Questionnaire from 'questionnaire'
import 'questionnaire/dist/index.css'

const Page = () => {
    const questions = [{
        question: 'What is React?',
        options: [
            "React is this",
            "React is that",
            "React is cool"
        ],
        answer: 0
    },...]

    return (
        <Questionnaire questions={questions}>
    )
}
```

### Use case - markdown blog posts

This component can be used in any framework that allows querying of markdown posts. Basically, the questions array would be added to the frontmatter of the markdown, and on querying, this component can be used with the questions property of the frontmatter assigned to the `questions` prop.

This example uses a [Gatsby]() Blog.

In the post markdown file:

```md
---
title: "Post title"
questions:
    [
        {
            question: "What is React?",
            options: ["React is this", "React is that", "React is cool"],
            answer: 0,
        },
        ...,
    ]
---

...
```

Wherever you query your post, you could add the following: (using the gatsby-starter post query format)

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Questionnaire from 'questionnaire'
---
export default ({data}) => {
    const {frontmatter: {title, questions}} = data.markdownRemark;
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Title</h1>
            <Questionnaire questions={questions}>
        </div>
    )
}
---
export const query = graphql`
  query($slug: String!) {
    markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      fields {
        slug
      }
      frontmatter {
        title
        questions
      }
    }
  }
`

```
